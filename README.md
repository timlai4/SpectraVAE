# SpectraVAE

The conditional Variational AutoEncoder (cVAE) gives a function from protein primary sequences (the condition) to the space of tandem MS/MS spectra. 
The model brings us a step closer to obtaining an algorithm that can distinguish whether tandem MS/Ms arise from the same peptide, an earlier project which I attempted to tackle directly in https://github.com/timlai4/SpectraClassifier. 
Similar to the previous project, the codebase and original idea are from https://github.com/lkytal/PredFull
